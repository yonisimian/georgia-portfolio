      <p data-aos="fade-left">
        I'm a 25 years old <strong>Computer Science B.Sc. student</strong> at The Open University of
        Israel. I'm currently pursuing my degree and am set to complete it in the summer of 2024.
        Alongside my studies, I have had the incredible opportunity to work as a
        <strong>R&D Software Development student</strong> at Intel since 2022, where I get to
        explore my passion for coding and software development.
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-right">
        In addition to my technical interests, I am a <strong>seasoned musician</strong>, having
        played the trombone since the age of 10. I also enjoy playing various other instruments,
        having being participating in various orchestras and bands. Music has always been an
        integral part of my life, and I find immense joy in composing and creating melodies in my
        free time, with a particular fondness for the bass and funk music.
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-left">
        I am passionate about <strong>music theory</strong>, viewing it as a human interpretation of
        mathematics, and I actively engage in music composition. Looking forward, one life goal of
        mine is to <strong>revolutionize the landscape of music composition</strong>, leveraging
        modern technology to create innovative and unprecedented musical experiences. I believe that
        the intersection of technology and music offers endless possibilities, and I am excited
        about the prospect of pursuing a Master's degree in Music Technology.
