      <p data-aos="fade-left">
        I am a <strong>Computer Science B.Sc. student</strong> at The Open University of Israel,
        slated to complete my degree in the summer of 2024. Currently employed as an
        <strong>R&D Software Developer</strong>
        at Intel since 2022, I possess a strong foundation in software development and coding. In my
        free time, I am an avid coder, with a particular focus on video game development.
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-right">
        Beyond the realm of technology, I am a <strong>seasoned musician</strong>, having played the
        trombone since the age of 10 and participating in various orchestras and bands. My
        enthusiasm for music extends to a diverse range of instruments and genres, with a particular
        fondness for the bass and funk music.
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-left">
        I am passionate about <strong>music theory</strong>, viewing it as a human interpretation of
        mathematics, and I actively engage in music composition. Looking forward, one life goal of
        mine is to <strong>revolutionize the landscape of music composition</strong>, leveraging
        modern technology to create innovative and unprecedented musical experiences.
      </p>
