      This march originated from a spontaneous trombone improvisation when I was 17 years old.
      My foray into orchestral composition led me to experiment with orchestrating the improvised melody, ultimately formalizing it into a march tailored for a wind orchestra.
      The composition premiered in 2022 during a notable performance by the Technion Orchestra, and a recording of this premiere is accessible through the link below.
