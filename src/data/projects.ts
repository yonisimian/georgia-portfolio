      This march started as an improvisation on my trombone when I was about 17 years old.
      At this time I began to experiment with composing for a whole orchestra, and I liked this improvised melody,
      so I wrote it as a march for a wind orchestra.
      In 2022 we played this march at the Technion Orchestra's concert, and the result is available in the link below.
